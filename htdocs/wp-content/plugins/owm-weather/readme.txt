OWM Weather is a powerful weather plugin for WordPress, based on the Open Weather Map API. It uses custom post types and shortcodes, and much more.

== Description ==

<strong>OWM Weather</strong> is derived from the discontinued plugin WP Cloudy. It uses many of the same settings but is completely separate.

---

OWM Weather is a flexible and easy-to-use weather plugin that allows the creation of unlimited different Weathers using Custom Post Types and the Open Weather Map API.

Create a Weather, select your location, choose the data and customize the look and feel with a few clicks.

Embed it anywhere with the automatically generated shortcode via copy and paste in posts, pages, text widgets, or directly in the PHP files of your theme.

With Custom Post Types, you minimize the maintenance: Override certain settings in the system setup and thereby change all Weather posts automatically.

Check out the documentation, layout examples and comparisons at the [OWM Weather Blog](https://ujsoftware.com/owm-weather-blog/).

== Features ==

= Weather information =
Current weather conditions, alerts, hourly up to 48 hours and daily up to 7 days.

= Completely customizable =
Data items can be selected and styled individually. Pick your measurement system, time format, and zone. Choose from several templates, fonts, or icon sets.
Developers have access through custom templates to the raw Open Weather Map data - converted to the selected measurement system, time format, and zone - to build a completely customized layout. A built-in debug template shows all options, data, and generated Html snippets.

= Shortcode Placement =
Use via Gutenberg block, as a widget or via shortcode in content and/or sidebar. Multiple completely different kinds of Weather can be shown on the same page.

= Weather Location =
The worldwide location can be specified by the OWM city id (available for over 200,000 cities), the city/country name via dynamic search, the zip code, the latitude/longitude, or the IP address of the user (geolocation).

= Unlimited weathers =
OWM Weather uses WordPress Custom Post Types which allows for an unlimited number of weathers.

= Weather-based Backgrounds =
Define up to 7 different background colors or images depending on the weather condition.

= Cache system =
Weather data is cached at a frequency defined by you. The data is then loaded from your server and you no longer depend on external sources. This avoids slowdowns and blocked page rendering.

= Open Weather Map API =
OWM Weather retrieves the weather information from the Open Weather Map website, a free weather data and forecast API. Get your free API key to avoid running into call limits. Note: It can take several hours before your API key is activated by OWM.

= Dashboard Weather =
You can include OWM Weather in your WordPress Dashboard as a widget.

= Flat & Retina responsive design =
Minimalist and flat responsive design, fully vectorial (SVG/CSS/Webfont), for a perfect display on all devices.

= Options panel =
Do you want to apply configuration settings globally? With our system options panel, you can bypass each setting on all weathers in just a few clicks. A weather page can opt-out of this bypass to ensure it always looks the same.

= Google Tag Manager =
Weather information (current temperature, cloudiness, short description, and category) can be pushed to the Google Tag Manager data layer to analyze web traffic by the weather.

= No ads. Free =
Our plugin will never display any advertising on your site. Did we mention it's a free WordPress plugin? We kindly ask for a donation should you like the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many cities are supported by OWM Weather? =

Over 200,000 cities from 238 countries and territories. Every location on earth is also selectable via latitude/longitude.

= How many differents weather can I create with OWM Weather? =

Unlimited due to WordPress Custom Post Types.

= In which languages is the weather data displayed? =

OWM Weather has been fully translated into Chilean, French, German, Russian, and Spanish. There are partial translations in Estonian, Italian, Hungarian, Hebrew, Polish, Danish, and Portuguese. Open Weather Map itself provides some of the data in most languages.

= How to define the unit Celsius or Fahrenheit? =

When creating your weather, choose "Imperial" for Fahrenheit or "Metric" for Celsius from the drop down list "Measurement system".

= How to define a custom title for my weather? =

Simply enter text in the "Custom city title". If you leave it blank, the default title will correspond to the Open Weather Map "City" field.

= Is it possible to add multiples weathers in a same page? =

Yes. Each weather can have a completely different setup and layout.

= What is the source of the datas? =

Open Weather Map (https://openwweathermap.com)

= Where is the global settings page? =

In WordPress admin, Settings menu, OWM Weather.

= Ads? =

No.

= Can I import/export weathers? =

Yes, using the default WordPress importer/exporter tool (free).

= Can I import/export global OWM Weather settings? =

Yes, in Settings > OWM Weather > Import/Export/Reset tab.

= Is OWM Weather compatible to WP Cloudy? =

Although many settings look alike, OWM Weather uses completely different weather pages and system settings so both can be activate at the same time.

= Why does the Visitor's Location search not work in my development environment? =

OWM Weather will first try the HTML5 GeoLocation feature. Should the user decline to share the geolocation or the geo-location cannot be determined, the search will then consult KeyCDN's IP location finder. It maps the visitor's browser IP address to the geographic location and provides the latitude and longitude information. The HTML5 GeoLocation tends to be much more accurate than IP-based GeoLocation.

Note regarding IP Location: A development environment uses usually a private network IP address that cannot be geolocated. You will end up with this error message: OWM Weather id '#####': OWM Error 400 (Nothing to geocode).In this case, please allow the HTML5 GeoLocation or use one of the other location options ( City Id, Longitude/Latitude, Zip/Country, or City/Country).

= Why is there a lag before the weather informtion gets displayed? =

OWM Weather has to make several API calls to OpenWeatherMap.com to retrieve the weather information. This retrieval runs in the background while the page is loading instead of blocking the whole page until the weather information is ready. It is the standard WordPress solution for displaying information that takes considerable time to compile. You can observe the same behavior on the WordPress Dashboard or Media Library. The Google Site Kit plugin is another example of this behavior.

= What is "cURL error 28: Failed to connect to api.openweathermap.org port 443: Connection timed out"?

This points to a connectivity issue between the server your domain is hosted and api.openweathermap.org. Please open a ticket with your hosting provider.
